# This file is intended to be used with the service here:
# http://www.makermusings.com/amazon-echo-utterance-expander/
# which generates a complete set of utternances based on the
# choices embedded below. See the website for more details.
# If making changes to this file, it should be processed again
# by the website to create the utterances to refresh
# sample-utterances.txt file which is then pasted in when
# creating/updating the Alexa skill
#
# Only copy and paste the lines below this comment block
#
# Note that the Alexa Skills Kit only seems to support about
# 2000 entries in the sample utterances, and each additional
# choice provided in the patterns below will double the
# overall number of utterances for that line!
